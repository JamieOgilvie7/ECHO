Hello, Welcome to my ECHO project!
This project is built with gradle, written in kotlin/java, and structured based on android app documentation.
I believe the build.gradle script should work to build it, but I have not been able to test it as the andriod studio app
doesn't seem to work on my computer and I don't have an android myself. I hope to one day expand the app to other phone
types (A Siwft app for IOS for example). Thank you to anyone looking to help with this project!
Best,
Jamie
